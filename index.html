        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

        <p>LaddoThis ("we", "our", or "the app") is a wedding planning app for South Asian weddings. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data the app collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>LaddoThis collects the following information that you provide directly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wedding details</strong> — couple names, wedding date, ceremony dates, and cultural community selection</li>
            <li><strong>Planning data</strong> — budgets, checklists, vendor contacts, gift records, music preferences, and notes</li>
            <li><strong>Photos</strong> — images you capture or select for your inspiration board</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>All your data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not have servers that store your personal information. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wedding details, budgets, checklists, vendors, gifts, and songs are saved in your device's local storage (UserDefaults).</li>
            <li>Inspiration photos are saved as files in your device's app directory.</li>
            <li>You may optionally back up your data to <strong>iCloud</strong> using Apple's iCloud key-value storage. This is controlled entirely by you. Photos are not included in iCloud backups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
        <p>The app requests your location (with your permission) for two purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather forecast</strong> — to show expected weather conditions for your wedding date</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor search</strong> — to help find nearby wedding vendors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Location data is used at <strong>kilometer-level accuracy</strong> (not precise). Your coordinates are sent to the Open-Meteo weather API to retrieve forecasts. Location data is not stored permanently or shared with any other service.</p>

        <h2>4. Camera and Photos</h2>
        <p>The app requests camera access to let you capture inspiration photos for your wedding board. Photos you capture or select from your library are stored locally on your device only. They are not uploaded to any server or shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> (<a href="https://open-meteo.com">open-meteo.com</a>) — a free, open-source weather API. We send your approximate location and wedding date to retrieve weather forecasts. Open-Meteo does not require an API key and does not track users. See their <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/terms">terms</a> for details.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple MapKit</strong> — used for vendor/business search. All searches are processed through Apple's services and are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> — used to process the optional premium purchase. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not receive or store any payment or financial information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>LaddoThis does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not collect usage data, behavioral data, or device identifiers. There are no ads in the app.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or transfer your personal data to third parties. The only external data transmission is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your approximate location to Open-Meteo for weather forecasts</li>
            <li>Search queries to Apple MapKit for vendor searches</li>
            <li>Purchase transactions processed by Apple</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Notifications</h2>
        <p>With your permission, the app sends local notifications to remind you of upcoming wedding planning tasks. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Export</h2>
        <p>You can generate a PDF summary of your wedding plans and share it using the standard iOS share sheet. The app does not control where you choose to send this PDF.</p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>LaddoThis is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> — all your data is visible within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong> — uninstalling the app removes all data</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong> — you can export your data as a PDF or back it up via iCloud</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
